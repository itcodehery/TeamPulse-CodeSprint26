*Project Name:* HappyMeal: Real-Time Surplus Food Redistribution
*Problem Statement ID:* CS01SW

*Team Name:* Team Pulse

*College Name:* CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Central Campus 

## Problem Statement
Food waste and hunger are two simultaneous global crises. While massive amounts of food are discarded daily, many communities struggle with food insecurity. The lack of a streamlined logistics network makes it difficult to transfer surplus food to those in need quickly and safely.

## Proposed Solution
HappyMeal is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between surplus food sources and NGOs. By leveraging real-time location services, the application connects donors with verified organizations to facilitate the efficient redistribution of food.
Our mobile application:
•  *Connects* donors (Caterers, Event Organizers, Individuals) with nearby verified NGOs via an intuitive map interface.
•  *Facilitates* real-time pickup requests for surplus food with "active/available" status tracking.
•  *Empowers* riders to discover, accept, and fulfill deliveries manually, ensuring autonomy and better logistics management.
•  *Ensures* trust through a robust "Proof of Service" workflow, requiring photographic evidence at both pickup and drop-off points.

## Innovation & Creativity
•  *Real-Time Surplus Logistics*: Unlike static directories, our app facilitates dynamic, real-time pickup and delivery of perishable goods using geolocation and live status updates.
•  *Role-Based Ecosystem*: Integrates three distinct user roles (Donor, NGO, Rider) into a single cohesive ecosystem, each with specialized dashboards.
•  *Digital Proof of Service*: Includes a custom-built Camera interface that overlays location coordinates and timestamps on pickup/delivery photos, ensuring absolute transparency and trust in the redistribution chain.
•  *Smart Rider Discovery*: Instead of rigid auto-assignment, we implemented a "First-to-Claim" availability model where qualified riders within proximity can view and accept jobs that fit their schedule.

## Technical Complexity & Stack
This project leverages a modern, cross-platform tech stack to ensure performance and scalability:

•  *Mobile Framework*: Flutter (SDK ^3.10.4) - For a high-performance, cross-platform (iOS/Android) user interface with premium "Glassmorphism" UI design.
•  *Backend & Database*: Supabase - Utilized for PostgreSQL database, Authentication, and Realtime subscriptions.
•  *State Management*: flutter_riverpod - For robust, scalable, and testable application state management.
•  *Maps & Location Services*: 
  - `flutter_map` & `latlong2`: For rendering performant, interactive OpenStreetMap tiles with custom markers.
  - `geolocator`: For precise real-time user location tracking.
•  *Hardware Integration*:
  - `camera`: Custom camera implementation for capturing verification images.
  - `vibration`: Haptic feedback for critical rider alerts (e.g., new order buzz).
•  *Routing*: go_router - For declarative and deep-linkable navigation.
•  *Typography*: google_fonts - Utilizing modern typefaces (Outfit) for a polished aesthetic.
•  *Architecture*: Feature-first architecture ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## Usability & Impact
*Users:*
1.  *Donors*: Individuals, restaurants, or event organizers who have surplus food.
2.  *NGOs*: Verified non-profit organizations seeking food for their beneficiaries.
3.  *Riders*: Volunteers or logistics partners who transport the food.

*Interaction:*
•  *Donors* post surplus food with quantity and type; requests are instantly broadcasted.
•  *Riders* receive a haptic "buzz" notification for new orders, view them on a map, and accept them manually.
•  *Verification*: Riders must capture a photo at the pickup point (Donor location) and drop-off point (NGO location) to progress the order status, ensuring quality and accountability.

*Impact:*
•  *Social*: Directly alleviates hunger in local communities by routing excess food to where it's needed most with a verifiable chain of custody.
•  *Environmental*: Reduces food waste, thereby lowering the carbon footprint associated with decomposing organic waste in landfills.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
•  [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed and configured.
•  A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project set up.

### Installation

1.  *Clone the Repository*
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd TeamPulse-CodeSprint26/hunger_n_waste
    ```

2.  *Install Dependencies*
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  *Environment Configuration*
    Create a `.env` file in the `hunger_n_waste` root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```env
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    ```

4.  *Database Setup*
    The application requires specific database tables, types, and RLS policies.
    👉 *[View the detailed Supabase Setup Guide](supabase_setup.md)* (if available) or ensure tables `rider_profiles`, `food_requests`, `organizations`, `donors` are created.

5.  *Run the Application*
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
