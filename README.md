## Problem Statement
Building a digital platform to connect surplus food sources with NGOs for real-time redistribution and waste reduction.

## Proposed Solution
We propose a mobile application that enables donors to instantly connect with nearby verified NGOs and request pickup of surplus food using real-time location services. The platform also assigns riders for collection and delivery, ensuring quick, transparent, and efficient redistribution of food to those in need.

## Innovation & Creativity 
The application integrates real-time mapping, live request tracking, and automated rider assignment to create a seamless end-to-end food redistribution workflow. Gamification features such as reward points and milestones encourage donors to contribute regularly, increasing engagement and long-term impact.

## Technical Complexity & Stack
We propose a mobile application that enables donors to instantly connect with nearby verified NGOs and request pickup of surplus food using real-time location services. The platform also assigns riders for collection and delivery, ensuring quick, transparent, and efficient redistribution of food to those in need.

## Usability & Impact
The intuitive interface allows donors, NGOs, and riders to perform tasks with minimal steps, reducing friction and improving adoption. By enabling faster redistribution of surplus food, the platform directly contributes to reducing food waste and supporting hunger relief efforts in local communities.
